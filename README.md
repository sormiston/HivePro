## Overview

_**HivePro Space Manager** is a full CRUD booking and reservation manager for a client's music rehearsal/recording studio environment.  It is designed and engineered as a student portfolio piece in compliance with Project 4 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, and implements a Rails-on-React stack routed to a POSTGRESQL relational database. _

<br>

## MVP

_The **HivePro Space Manager** will allow users to book studio time and the checking out of special equipment during their session.  HivePro makes this convenient by producing readouts that display either a) availabiltiy of all rooms for a desired time slot, with parameter filters 
.for room size and needed equipment or b) all available times for a particular room, on a room detail page.  Room details pages will include specifications of room size and non-transportable equipment.  Additionally, HivePro allows transportable equipment to be rented during a session from the studio stockpile, subject to availability.  The availability of transportable equipment items can be included as a parameter filter to narrow the scope of possible appointments.  A registered user will have the ability to update or delete their appointment up until 36 hours prior to the start of their session.

### Goals

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|   React Router   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.

***

## Post-MVP

- Add an admin function that manages the allocation of movable equipment.  This will take the form of a map display that visually juxtaposes the current location of an item against where that item must be at a given time of day.  Depending on the time of day, required movements will be summarized in an itinerary readout, with clickable buttons to mark the movement "complete" and update the items location.  This screen will only be accessible with an administrative login.

- Offer functionality to secure regular time slots to users who take subscription offer

## Code Showcase

> Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.

## Code Issues & Resolutions

> Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.
